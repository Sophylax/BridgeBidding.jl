    BridgeState(hands, tricks = nothing; starting_player = WEST, nsvul = false, ewvul = false, nonzeropass = false)

Structure for representing a bridge bidding state.

# Fields
- `hands::Vector{Vector{Int}}`: Vector of four Vectors, one for each player/side. Each inner Vector contains 13 integers for the cards.
- `history::Vector{Int}`: Vector of bids made until this point.
- `player::Int`: Currently acting player.
- `starting_player::Int`: The first player to bid.
- `nsvul::Bool`: Vulnerability information for N/S.
- `ewvul::Bool`: Vulnerability information for E/W.
- `tricks::Union{Array{Int, 2},Nothing}`: Number of tricks taken by North-South for all trumps and leads. First dimension is for trumps and second one is for leads.
May also be nothing, indicating a game without double dummy data present.
- `parscore::Union{Int, Nothing}`: Stored par score, if it's calculated before.
- `nonzeropass::Bool`: Whether the state gives negative par to all pass game.
